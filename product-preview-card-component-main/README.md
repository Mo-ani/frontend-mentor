## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).Coded by [Me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Mo-ani)

## The challenge

In this challenge I have practiced more than css and html, I know I'm still a novice but at least I'm still practicing.

I have added some extras, which give it a better look. ðŸ˜„

## Build with

+ Semantic HTML5 markup
+ CSS custom properties
+ Flexbox
+ CSS Grid
+ Mobile-first workflow


## Notes

It took me longer than expected, but in the end I feel happy that I finished it.
